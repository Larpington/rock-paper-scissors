# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game that is executed in the browser console. This was my first time playing around with javascript and making anything.

Stuff I learned: 
*How to properly execute if statements
*How to use the return value of an if statement to increment a variable
*How to mass replace text using vscode
*How scope works with variables
*How to generate a random number
*There's something coming up called a for loop that would have made the game function way easier
